This is a repository of random projects in various states of broken, unfinished,
and incomplete. Some of it might turn into something interesting someday, but
most of it will probably just stay here.

================================================================================

arduino:	Random small toy code written for Arduino that might be useful
		for somebody else.

benchmarks:	Set of small benchmarks for a few different implementations of
		memcpy() and memset() on x86_64 CPUs.

chess:		A half-baked chess engine I wrote for a class in college. It
		plays to capture your pieces, not checkmate you.

flying:		A collection of LaTeX checklists for airplanes I fly.

tvedit:		Weird mess of scripts for text-only video editing (lol).

vorps:		Work in progress, code to compute position using VOR beacons.
