Diving Tools: Random collection of little programs related to diving
================================================================================

DISCLAIMER: THESE ARE EDUCATIONAL TOYS. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THEM
	    FOR REAL DIVES OR REAL ASCENTS TO ALTITUDE AFTER DIVING.

Internally, all pressures are in Bar, and all times are in seconds.

A number of things normally accounted for in models (e.g. water vapor in breath)
are not accounted for. Generally, this should make the code too conservative.

The calculations assume square profiles and instant depth changes, so in general
they should give overestimates of loading. Be sure to add a surface interval at
the end, otherwise no off-gassing is accounted for at all in the ascent.

The programs are all configurable with the following arguments:

	-g:	Change the GF-Hi used to compute ceilings (default 100)
	-a:	Change the surface pressure (default 1.013bar)
	-p:	Change PPN2 for calculations (default 0.79 (air))
	-m:	Change the model used (default "Buhlmann ZH-L16C Nitrogen")
	-n:	Show negative pressures, instead of just displaying zero

When changing the PPN2 setting, we assume air is breathed during surface
intervals (any vector where ambiant pressure is >= surface pressure).

Altitude Calculator
-------------------

This tool uses a set of dives and surface intervals you provide to calculate
minimum ambiant pressures tolerable without exceeding the M-values (+GF) for
various Haldanian decompression models.

To use the tool, simply provide a series of "TIME DEPTH" pairs on the command
line (meters and feet are supported). For example, this computes GF100 ceilings
after a series of dives I did in Catalina last a few weeks ago:

NDL Calculator

This tool computes how much time its possible to spend at a given ambiant
pressure before returning to the surface would exceed the M-value (+GF)
calculated by the choosen model.

To use the tool, simply provide a series of "TIME DEPTH" pairs on the command
line (meters and feet are supported). For example, this computes GF70 NDLS at
100ft after spending 5 minutes at 100ft:

	{0}[calvinow@Mozart ~] ./ndl-calculator -g 70 :5 100ft -d 100ft

	Load: 0.835 NDL: 2036s
	Load: 0.828 NDL: 2426s
	Load: 0.822 NDL: 2853s
	Load: 0.817 NDL: 3460s
	Load: 0.813 NDL: 4138s

These numbers are weird because we don't account for the ascent at all: your
fancy dive computer assumes some maximal ascent rate when it calculates this
number for you, so the fast tissues don't limit your diving nearly as much as
they limit the results of this tool.
